The custom_zulip_files mechanism allows you to test edits to Zulip before
making changes in the upstream repo. This works by making cloning the Zulip
repo and then copying the contents of this directory on top of the checkout as
part of the docker build. As an example if you want to test a change to
scripts/setup/generate-self-signed-cert you would copy it to
custom_zulip_files/scripts/setup/generate-self-signed-cert and make local edits
before running docker-compose build.

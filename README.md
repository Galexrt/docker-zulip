## Requirements
Zulip recommends at least about 1.9GB RAM on the machine you are running on.

## How to configure the container

See the [Configuration](https://github.com/Galexrt/docker-zulip/wiki/Configuration) Page for infos about configuring the container to suit your needs.

***

## How to get the container running
### To pull the image run
`docker pull quay.io/galexrt/zulip:1.8.1-0`
or
`docker pull galexrt/zulip:1.8.1-0`

### For the latest development image run
`docker pull quay.io/galexrt/zulip:dev`

***

## **Configure your `docker-compose.yml`, before running the container!**
**If you don't configure it, you'll end up with a misconfigured Zulip Instance!**
**You need a working SMTP server for  Zulip to allow the creation of the first user!**

Check the wiki page on how to configure the image, [here](https://github.com/galexrt/docker-zulip/wiki/Configuration). [Wiki Page](https://github.com/galexrt/docker-zulip/wiki/Configuration)

***

## Starting the container
To start the container, you have to use either use `docker-compose` or `kubernetes`:

**Don't forget to configure your `docker-compose.yml` properly!!**

### Using docker-compose
Change to the root of the source folder and use `docker-compose up`.

### Using Kubernetes
A Kubernetes pod file is in the `kubernetes/` folder. The command to run it would be `kubectl create -f ./kubernetes/`.

***

## Creating Zulip User
To be able to create a Zulip user, you create a Realm inside Zulip.
To trigger creation of a Realm you can run:
```bash
docker-compose exec zulip sudo -H -u zulip -g zulip /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py generate_realm_creation_link
```
Follow the link you just got printed and follow the instructions to create an user account and a realm in Zulip.

After creating an user and a realm in Zulip through the link, move on to [Adding User to Admins](#Adding-User-to-Admins) if you want to add an user to the admin group.

### Adding User to Admins
For adding the created user to the admins in the realm created in Zulip.
You need to replace `REALM_ID` with the lowercase name of the Realm created and the `EMAIL_ADDRESS_OF_USER` with the email address of the user you created.
```bash
docker-compose exec zulip sudo -u zulip /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py knight -f -r REALM_ID EMAIL_ADDRESS_OF_USER
```
After this the user should be added to admins in the realm and you should see more settings after a reload of the Zulip webpage in your browser.

***

## Troubleshooting
### zulip-django exited
The main reason for this to happen is that you are missing a config file named `uwsgi.ini`.
The get this file run:
```
// This command copy the output of file uwsgi.ini into your data volume on the host.
// Replace `YOUR_ZULIP_DATA_PATH` with your path.
host$ docker run --rm quay.io/galexrt/zulip:1.5.2 cat /etc/zulip/uwsgi.ini > YOUR_ZULIP_DATA_PATH/settings/etc-zulip/uwsgi.ini
```
